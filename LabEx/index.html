                        <h1>Who was Joe Frazier?</h1>
                        <p>In the annals of boxing history, few names shine as brightly as Joe Frazier’s. Frazier, often
                            affectionately referred to as “Smokin’ Joe,” was a true legend in the sport, and his
                            remarkable
                            career was defined by his unwavering determination, explosive left hook, and the indomitable
                            spirit that allowed him to survive and thrive in an era populated by iconic boxers like
                            Muhammad
                            Ali and George Foreman. This article pays tribute to Joe Frazier, exploring how he not only
                            survived but triumphed in the golden age of heavyweight boxing.</p>

                        <h1>Who Was Muhammad Ali?</h1>
                        <p>Muhammad Ali was a boxer, philanthropist, and social activist who is universally regarded as
                            one
                            of the greatest athletes of the 20th century. Ali became an Olympic gold medalist in 1960
                            and
                            the world heavyweight boxing champion in 1964. Following his suspension for refusing
                            military
                            service in the Vietnam War, Ali reclaimed the heavyweight title two more times during the
                            1970s,
                            winning famed bouts against Joe Frazier and George Foreman along the way. Ali retired from
                            boxing in 1981 and devoted much of his time after to philanthropy. He earned the
                            Presidential
                            Medal of Freedom in 2005.</p>

                        The rivalry between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier remains one of the most iconic in sports
                        history.
                        Their trilogy of fights from 1971 to 1975 captured the world’s attention and showcased the best
                        of
                        heavyweight boxing. It was more than just a battle in the ring—it was a clash of personalities,
                        ideologies, and legacies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Ali-Frazier rivalry was more than just three fights; it was a defining chapter in boxing
                        history. Ali went on to become an even bigger global icon, while Frazier remained a respected
                        and beloved warrior. Though their relationship was rocky for years, Ali later expressed regret
                        for his harsh words, and the two shared moments of reconciliation.

                        Their battles will forever be remembered as the gold standard of boxing rivalries—fierce,
                        emotional, and unforgettable.
